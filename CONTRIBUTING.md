# How to contribute?

This repository is a public repo so that you can contribute in case of mistakes, omissions, etc.
Please note that this repository is there for collectively writing the [Automation SIG's](https://www.first.org/global/sigs/automation/) Best Current Practices (BCP) document on 
Incident Response Automation.

We appreciate Pull Requests (PRs) via the fork & PR model: 

1. fork the project, 
2. look at the `bcp-guide/` folder and at the templates for documenting use-cases as well as tools
3. familiarize yourself a bit with the rest of the document
4. make your additions
5. git commit
6. and ... send a PR.

Thank you!
It's a living document, so periodic reviews are good.
