- Document our kowledge - in the SIG, write a common best practices document for automation in the the context of incidence response (IR)
- Compile a list of tools for automation in IR including their focus areas
- Host at least three meetings per year, one being at the FIRST annual conference and another two (usually virtual) meetings around February and September;
- Disseminate best practices in term of CSIRT organisation to support automation needs;
- Identifying ways to provide agile and effective automation;
