# automation-sig

The FIRST.org [Automation SIG](https://www.first.org/global/sigs/automation) allows its members to discuss topics of IR and DFIR automation.
See the link above for a description of its goals and deliverables.

This code repository contains the markdown code for the https://www.first.org/global/sigs/automation sub-web space on first.org.

The main page is  in [index.md](index.md). 
The [bcp-guide](bcp-guide) folder contains our Best Common Practices document on Automation.

*Note on branches*: all commits should go to the `develop` branch only. That's the branch where we work.
If you are an external contributor (PRs welcome!), please for the repo and make a PR against the `develop` branch.
If you are an active SIG member, it's ok to currently commit directly against `develop`, though PRs are preferred since they allow for a proper review.

The `main` branch gets synced against the (sub-)web space (and is thus a protected branch).
The `stage` branch gets synced against the staging area.

Questions should be addressed to the [SIG-chairs](https://www.first.org/global/sigs/automation).
