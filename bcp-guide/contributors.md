# Contributors and how to contribute

This document is a living document. It lives on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FIRSTdotorg/automation-sig-www/).
You can edit it by forking the repository and making a git pull request (PR). In fact, we encourage you to do so!
Nothing is as quickly as outdated as tools and tech stacks. Therefore, if you find inaccuracies or - most probably - omissions (missing tools or use-cases), 
please do fork it and send us a PR.

The core team (Automation SIG co-chairs) will review them.
