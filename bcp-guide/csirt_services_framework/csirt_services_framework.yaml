  description: 'Information Security Event Management aims to identify information
    security incidents based on the correlation and analysis of security events from
    by a wide variety of event and contextual data sources. In larger organizations,
    this service area is sometimes fully or partially assigned to a Security Operations
    Center (SOC), which might additionally also perform first- or even second-level
    Information Security Incident Management such as initiating mitigations or adjustments
    of security controls. As any Information Security Incident Management service
    depends on qualified and accurate data about information security events, the
    interface between a SOC and the assigned CSIRT is crucial.[4](#fn-4)


    The following services are considered as offerings of this particular service
    area:


    * Monitoring and detection

    * Event analysis'
  services:
  - id: '5.1'
    name: Monitoring and detection
    purpose: Implement automated, continuous processing of a wide variety of information
      security event sources and contextual data in order to identify potential information
      security incidents, such as attacks, intrusions, data breaches or security policy
      violations.Manage log sources and sensors.Manage the portfolio of detection
      use cases through their entire lifecycle.Manage of contextual data sources for
      detection and enrichment.
    description: Based on logs, NetFlow data, IDS alerts, sensor networks, external
      sources, or other available information security event data, apply a range of
      methods from simple logic or pattern matching rules to the application of statistical
      models or machine learning in order to identify potential information security
      incidents. This can involve a vast amount of data and typically, but not necessarily,
      requires specialized tools such as Security Information and Event Management
      (SIEM) or big data platforms to process. An important objective of continuous
      improvement is to minimize the amount of false alarms that need to be analyzed
      as part of the Analyzing service.Sensors and log sources need operational management
      throughout their lifecycle. They must be deployed, onboarded, and decommissioned.
      Outages, data quality/scope, and configuration issues must be identified and
      resolved. Sensors that have some form of configuration such as pattern definitions
      need their configuration maintained in order to remain effective. Sensors may
      also include external detection services or Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
      sources, if they form the basis for detection use cases.New detection approaches
      are developed, tested, and improved, and eventually onboarded into a detection
      use case in production. Instructions for analyst triage, qualification, and
      correlation need to be developed, for example in the form of playbooks and Standard
      Operating Procedures (SOPs). Use cases that do not perform well, i.e., that
      have an unfavorable benefit/effort ratio, need to be improved, redefined, or
      abandoned. The portfolio of detection use cases should be expanded in a risk-oriented
      way and in coordination with preventive controls.The various contextual data
      sources that are involved in detection and enrichment need to be managed throughout
      their lifecycle. These can be live APIs to or exports from other IT systems
      such as a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), Identity and Access Management
      (IAM), or Threat Intel systems, or entirely separate data sets that need to
      be managed manually. The latter would be the case for indicator lists, watchlists
      and whitelists to suppress false positives.
    outcome: Potential information security incidents are identified for analysis
      as part of the Analyzing service.A reliable stream of relevant information security
      events is available as input for detection use cases.A portfolio of effective
      detection use cases that are relevant to the constituency is developed.Up to
      date contextual data is available for both detection and enrichment.

        ratio, need to be improved, redefined, or abandoned. The portfolio of detection
        use cases should be expanded in a risk-oriented way and in coordination with
        preventive controls.
      outcome: A portfolio of effective detection use cases that are relevant to the

        would be the case for indicator lists, watchlists and whitelists to suppress
        false positives.The flow of detected potential information security incidents
        must be triaged and each one qualified as an information security incident
        (true positive) or as a false alarm (false positive) using manual and/or automated
        analysis. This may require manual or automated gathering of additional information,
        depending on the detection use case. Priority should be given to the analysis
        of potentially more critical information security incidents to ensure timely
        reaction to what is most important. Structured qualification of detected potential
        information security incidents enables effective continuous improvement in
        a directed way by identifying detection use cases, data sources, or processes
        with quality issues.
      outcome: Up to date contextual data is available for both detection and enrichment.Qualified
        and correlated information security incidents are available as input to the
        Information Security Incident Management service area and false positives
        are qualified for continuous improvement.

      a false alarm (false positive). Because analysts have a limited number of potential
      information security incidents they can analyze, and in order to avoid alert
      fatigue, automation is key. Mature tooling facilitates effective triage by enriching
      with context information, assigning risk scores based on the criticality of
      affected assets and identities and/or automatically identifying related information
      security events. Recurring cases that can be automated should be identified
      and automated. Potential information security incidents with higher criticality
      should be analyzed before less critical ones. In addition to qualification as
      true or false positives, a more fine-grained qualification is an important input
      for continuous improvement of detection use cases as well as the management
      of log sources, sensors, and contextual data sources. More fine-grained qualification
      can also support the definition of higher-quality KPIs for measuring the success
      of this service area.

        the architecture, usage, or implementation flaw(s) that caused or exposed
        systems, networks, users, organizations, etc. to the kind of attack or exploit
        or compromise as exercised against the targets of an information security
        incident. It is also concerned with the circumstances in which an attacker
        could compromise more systems based on the initial access to gain further
        access.
      outcome: The information security incident and the way in which malicious actors
        initially gained access and used it further on is understood so that remediation
        or mitigation methods can be determined to minimize the risk of future exposure
        or exploitation by eliminating the root causes.

      as communications are crafted and released. In return, a CSIRT must also be
      equipped to receive incoming feedback, reports, comments, and questions from
      a variety of sources based on its own communication.A security incident touches
      on many internal and potentially external entities and, possibly, systems, and
      networks. As CSIRTs are a central point for receiving reports of potential information
      security incidents, they also serve as a hub for notifying authorized points
      of contact about them. The notification usually will provide not only the appropriate
      technical details but also information about the expected response and a point
      of contact for any fellow-up.As the response to an information security incident
      progresses, more analysis results and reports from potentially other security
      experts, CSIRTs, or victims become available.As many entities are potentially
      involved in responding to an information security incident, it is necessary
      to track the status of all communication and activities. This involves the actions
      requested by a CSIRT or requests for sharing of further information as well
      as requests for technical analysis of artefacts s or the sharing of indicators
      of compromise, information about other victims, etc. This primarily occurs when
      the CSIRT is reliant on expertise and resources outside of the direct control
      of the CSIRT to effectuate the actions necessary to mitigate an incident. But
      it also occurs inside larger organizations for which an internal CSIRT coordinates
      the mitigation and recovery activities.Delivering concise and factual information
      about the current status of activities requested or carried out in response
      to an information security incident. Instead of waiting to be pulled for such
      information as part of an ongoing coordinated action as required for any successful
      response, timely reports are critical to enable effective coordination.Communicating
      with the media is unavailable in many cases. While CSIRTs usually try to avoid
      such contact, it is important to realize that the media can help to mitigate
      specific types of ongoing and large-scale attacks causing information security
      incidents. For this it is necessary to explain what is causing the information
      security incidents and explain the impact on users and/or organizations. In
      some cases, a CSIRT might choose to provide this information already in a manner
      suitable for release to the public, but this certainly requires specific skills
      inside the CSIRT not readily available in most. In any case, if a CSIRT communicates
      with the media, it must take great care to simplify the technical issues as
      much as possible and leave out all confidential information.
    outcome: 'The response is successfully coordinated based on well-informed entities
