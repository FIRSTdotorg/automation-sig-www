# Overview

This document tries to give an overview of typical automation tasks in IT security.

We start by defining some terms and limiting the [scope](scope.md) of this document. After all, the term "Automation" is overly broad. Limiting the scope to the most useful and typical automation use-cases in IT Security Teams / CSIRTs / SOCs allows us to stay focused. Essentially, as every IT practitioner knows, there is a tendency to try to automate everything. This is no different in IT Security. But the question "is it worth it to automate" needs to be looked at closely. One of the  first good outcomes of the FIRST Automation SIG's work is therefore the consolidated list of worthy [use-cases](use-cases/). 

Next, we discuss and list the common [standards](standards_and_related_work) which help both in modelling as well as in facilitation interoperability between different tools.

Use-cases fall into different groups which can be classified by the [CSIRT services framework](https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2-1).

For a service area and per use-case there are several tools which might work for automating tasks.

The [tools](tools/) chapter discusses the common tools for automation.
