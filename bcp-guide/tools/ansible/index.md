# Ansible

Ansible provides an agentless tool for general IT automation. It's not specifically security focused but it 
makes an easy automation language for interacting with systems in an automated way. The Ansible Automation 
Platform also makes it easy to hand playbooks over to analysts and restrict permissions and inputs. It also 
provides an API to kick off playbooks, which can be handy if you don't want to couple your automation 
implementation to a particular SOAR vendor.
