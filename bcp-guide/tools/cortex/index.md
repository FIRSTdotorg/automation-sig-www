# Cortex

Cortex tries to solve a common problem frequently encountered by SOCs, CSIRTs and security researchers in the 
course of threat intelligence, digital forensics and incident response: how to analyze observables they have 
collected, at scale, by querying a single tool instead of several? Cortex, an open source and free software, 
has been created by TheHive Project for this very purpose. Observables, such as IP and email addresses, URLs, 
domain names, files or hashes, can be analyzed one by one or in bulk mode using a Web interface. Analysts can 
also automate these operations thanks to the Cortex REST API.
