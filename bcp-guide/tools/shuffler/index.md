# Shuffler

Shuffle started as a project in mid-2019 because of a few automation related problems that needed more attention 
in the CERT/SIRT community. Available automation solutions in the security industry are trying to do everything 
at once handle tickets, indicators, threat intel and much more in a single platform, while our goal is to build 
the best solution to fit all your existing tools following the Unix philosophy: Do One Thing and Do It Well
