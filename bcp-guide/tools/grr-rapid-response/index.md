# GRR Rapid Response

GRR Rapid Response is an incident response framework focused on remote live forensics. It consists of a python 
client (agent) that is installed on target systems, and python server infrastructure that can manage and talk to 
clients. The goal of GRR is to support forensics and investigations in a fast, scalable manner to allow analysts 
to quickly triage attacks and perform analysis remotely.
