# OpenSearch

OpenSearch is a fork of ElasticSearch. 
Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. 
It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.
Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is dual-licensed under the source-available Server Side Public License and the Elastic license, while other parts fall under the proprietary (source-available) Elastic License.
Official clients are available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Ruby and many other languages. 
According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine.
