      IntelMQ is a solution for IT security teams (CERTs & CSIRTs, SOCs, abuse departments, etc.) for collecting and 
      processing security feeds (such as log files) using a message queuing protocol. ... 
      Its main goal is to give to incident responders an easy way to collect & process threat intelligence thus 
      improving the incident handling processes of CERTs.
      IntelMQ can be used for - automated incident handling - situational awareness - automated notifications - as data 
      collector for other tools - etc.

      The n6 platform has been created by CERT Polska as a system designed to collect, process and share information 
      about network events and possible security incidents. During one year period there are milions of security 
      incidents being processed from Poland as well as from other parts the world. N6 is fully automatic. Its goal is 
      to be efficient, reliable and prompt to deliver large amount of information about security incidents to proper 
      entities: network owners, administrators and operators.

      Cortex tries to solve a common problem frequently encountered by SOCs, CSIRTs and security researchers in the 
      course of threat intelligence, digital forensics and incident response: how to analyze observables they have 
      collected, at scale, by querying a single tool instead of several? Cortex, an open source and free software, 
      has been created by TheHive Project for this very purpose. Observables, such as IP and email addresses, URLs, 
      domain names, files or hashes, can be analyzed one by one or in bulk mode using a Web interface. Analysts can 
      also automate these operations thanks to the Cortex REST API.
