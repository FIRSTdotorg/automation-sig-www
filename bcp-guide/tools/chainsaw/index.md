# Chainsaw

Chainsaw provides a powerful ‘first-response’ capability to quickly identify threats within Windows forensic artefacts such as Event Logs and MFTs.
Chainsaw offers a generic and fast method of searching through event logs for keywords, and by identifying threats using built-in support for Sigma detection rules, and via custom Chainsaw detection rules.
