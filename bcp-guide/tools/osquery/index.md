# OSQUERY
osquery is an operating system instrumentation framework for Windows, OS X (macOS), and Linux. The tools
make low-level operating system analytics and monitoring both performant and intuitive.

Among other features, it allows to schedule queries to be executed across the entire infrastructure. It
aggregates the results over time and generate logs that can be user to trigger alerts. It is also capable
to open an interactive query console to try new queries and explore the operating system.
