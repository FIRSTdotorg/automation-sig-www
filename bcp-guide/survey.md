# Stocktaking of SOAR solutions

The aim of the yearly SOAR stocktaking is to identify tools, services and initiatives that can support organisations on their security automation journey. This is a space where vendors, experts and enthusiasts can share information about products or experiences using SOAR solutions. 

In particular, our goal is to:

1. ease the discovery of SOAR opportunities, such as new tools, use cases and services;
2. provide a community space where experiences can be shared; 
3. keep up with developments in this space.

We **strongly** welcome suggestions of open source projects, including those that are no longer maintained, as they may raise the interest of other community members.

The survey can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17ebftz2NcFUSWzAyHP271WE6akz8U6ckRFFaJQfjzzw/prefill). You may submit multiple entries.
The survey will run from June to September 2023.
