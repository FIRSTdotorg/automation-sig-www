# Motivation

The FIRST.org Automation Special Interest Group ("Automation SIG") was formed in 2022 after several of its members identified a need to discuss ideas on how to best automate their respective IT security response (IR, CTI, DFIR, etc.). The SIG aims at documenting common practices in IT Security Automation across diverse use-cases and (sub-)fields of IT Security by exchanging notes and ideas.

While "information sharing" and "sharing is caring" have long been the rallying cries of the infosec community, there hasn't been much guidance on how to (automatically) deal with the given (and shared) information on incidents or IoCs. As a result, the SIG discusses and reflects on the practices for handling particular use cases and how automation can move the needle in the favor of the defender. Secondly, this initiative develops a list of proven existing tools for various automated tasks.

The SIG believes that automation has various levels and has been there long before the orchestrator era. An ill defined and undocumented procedure cannot be automated. Documenting a process and/or procedures would enable an organisation to begin automating parts of it. In the past, system architects used to try to link software together in an ad hoc manner. Design patterns and a move to APIs and middleware that connects different tools, was the natural step towards the orchestrators we have today. We are witnessing this change in the security domain. While, non-machine readable playbooks remain an important source of documentation, machine-readable encodings, such as workflows, are crucial for integrating battle-tested practices and standard operating procedures. 

Note that this document does not attempt to list every potential task that CERT, CSIRT, and SOC teams may attempt to automate.  However, the SIG tries to identify common tasks and ways to address them across seen practices. Therefore, we hope that this document is useful for the reader - after all, the internet brought us all closer together, but also exposed us the same common (IT security) problems.
