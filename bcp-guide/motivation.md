# Motivation

The FIRST.org Automation Special Interest Group ("Automation SIG") was formed
in 2022 after several of its members identified a need to discuss ideas on how
to best automate their respective IT security response (IR, CTI, DFIR, etc.).
The SIG aims at documenting common best current practices in IT Security
Automation across diverse use-cases and (sub-)fields of IT Security by
exchanging notes and ideas.

While "information sharing" and "sharing is caring" have long been the rallying
cries of the infosec community, there hasn't been much guidance on how to
(automatically) deal with the given (and shared) information on incidents or
IoCs. As a result, the SIG discusses and reflects on the practices for handling
particular use cases and how automation can move the needle in the favor of the
defender. Secondly, this initiative develops a list of proven existing tools
for various automated tasks.

The SIG believes that automation has various levels and has been there  for a long time.
In fact, one could argue that "using IT" for incident response, CTI, DFIR, etc. is a sort 
of "automation". This SIG however believes that the term "automation" should go further
and the aim of any IT Security process automation is to remove the manual work load 
from incident responders as much as possible.

"Automation" entails understanding your processes first: an ill defined and
undocumented procedure cannot be automated. Documenting a process and/or
procedures would enable an organisation to begin automating parts of it. 

Playbooks play an important role in understanding our processes.
We are witnessing this change in the security domain. While, non-machine
readable playbooks remain an important source of documentation,
machine-readable encodings, such as workflows, are crucial for integrating
battle-tested practices and standard operating procedures. 

Note that this document does not attempt to list every potential task that
CERT, CSIRT, and SOC teams may attempt to automate.  However, the SIG tries to
identify common tasks and ways to address them across seen practices.

**Note well**: In the effort to bring value early on, we decided to go ahead and make the resources which we currently have available.
However, since this is a living document, we would like to encourage you to contribute.

# How this document is created / how to contribute

(See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING)).

This document is *a living document*. The Automation SIG put this out here as a
starting point on github.  We highly encourage **pull requests** on our public
[github repository](https://github.com/FIRSTdotorg/automation-sig-www) for this
document.

With the Automation SIG's initial start and your contribution (pull requests)
we will have useful document that you can use to point your management to.

We hope that this document is useful for the reader - after all, the internet
brought us all closer together, but also exposed us the same common (IT
security) problems.
